Problem Statement: Amazon Sales Analysis with Power BI
Background

E-commerce businesses, especially large platforms like Amazon, accumulate enormous volumes of data—covering metrics such as sales revenue, product performance, customer feedback, and trends over time. Translating this raw data into meaningful insights is critical for optimizing operations, improving marketing strategy, inventory planning, and overall business performance.

Objective

Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw Amazon sales data into actionable intelligence. The dashboard should facilitate a unified view of high-level metrics, trend analysis, category-level insights, product-level performance, and interactive filtering capabilities, empowering stakeholders to make data-informed decisions.

Scope & Key Deliverables

Data Collection & Preparation

Import sales transaction data, product details, and review counts.

Perform data cleaning and modeling, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

KPI Overview

Show year-to-date (YTD) total sales revenue.

Display quarter-to-date (QTD) sales figures.

Count of total units sold or unique products.

Total number of customer reviews, representing customer engagement or satisfaction.

Trend Analysis

Monthly sales trend visualized via line chart to highlight seasonality or promotional spikes.

Weekly or quarterly bar charts to reveal short-term fluctuations and performance patterns.

Category-Level Insights

Implement slicers or filters for users to narrow down by category, time period, or other dimensions.

Ensure smooth drill-down from overview metrics to deeper insights.

Design & Usability

Build an intuitive, visually appealing dashboard using Power BI’s interactive features.

Use consistent formatting, clear themes, and responsive layouts.
